      <description>Introduction Python Python is a simple language with straightforward syntax. There are two major Python versions; Python 2 and Python 3. This tutorial uses Python 3 because it is the most up-to-date and supports newer features. For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the “print” statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses and also includes a newline, unlike in C.</description>

      <description>Variables and Types You do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object. Variables can hold any value and are case-sensitive. This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables.
Variable Names There are a number of rules governing the naming of variables:
 Variable names cannot start with a number There can�t be any spaces in a variable name Reserved words cannot be used in variable names  Numbers Python supports integer and floating-point numbers.</description>
