      <description>Introduction What can Python do?  Python can be used on a server to create web applications. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.  Python Python is a simple language with straightforward syntax.</description>

      <description>Introduction Python Python is a simple language with straightforward syntax. There are two major Python versions; Python 2 and Python 3. This tutorial uses Python 3 because it is the most up-to-date and supports newer features. For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the “print” statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses and also includes a newline, unlike in C.</description>

      <description>Python Dictionaries A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.
Example Create and print a dictionary:
thisdict = { &amp;quot;brand&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Ford&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;model&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Mustang&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;: 1964 } print(thisdict)  Accessing Dictionary Items You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:
Example Get the value of the &amp;ldquo;model&amp;rdquo; key:</description>

      <description>Python Functions You&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to use functions, methods, and packages to efficiently leverage the code that brilliant Python developers have written. The goal is to reduce the amount of code you need to solve challenging problems!
Functions There are a number of rules governing the naming of variables:
 Variable names cannot start with a number There cannot be any spaces in a variable name Reserved words cannot be used in variable names  Create a list The equals sign = is used to assign values to variables</description>

      <description>Python Lists Learn to store, access, and manipulate data in lists: the first step toward efficiently working with huge amounts of data.
What are lists? A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.
Create a list myList = [&amp;quot;apple&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;orange&amp;quot;] # Assigning an integer value  Accessing List Items Accessing a Range of List Items Change Item Values Copying a List myList = [&amp;quot;apple&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cherry&amp;quot;] newList = myList.</description>

      <description>Python Tuples A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.
Example Create a Tuple:
thistuple = (&amp;quot;apple&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cherry&amp;quot;) print(thistuple)  Access Tuple Items You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:
Example Print the second item in the tuple:
thistuple = (&amp;quot;apple&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cherry&amp;quot;) print(thistuple[1])  Negative Indexing Negative indexing means beginning from the end, -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.</description>

      <description>Variables and Types Variables are reserved memory locations used to store values. Python has several basic data types that behave in ways that are similar to other programming languages. You do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object. Variables can hold any value and are case-sensitive. This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables.</description>
