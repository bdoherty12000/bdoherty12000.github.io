There are two major Python versions; Python 2 and Python 3. This tutorial uses Python 3 because it is the most up-to-date and supports newer features. For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the “print” statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses and also includes a newline, unlike in C. To print a string in Python 3, just write:\nprint(\u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;)  Indentation Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces. For example:\nx = 1 if x == 1: print(\u0026quot;x is 1.\u0026quot;) # indented four spaces  "},{"idx":5,"href":"/posts/","title":"Posts","content":""},{"idx":6,"href":"/docs/page-two/","title":"Variables and Types","content":" Variables and Types Variables are reserved memory locations used to store values. Python has several basic data types that behave in ways that are similar to other programming languages. You do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object. Variables can hold any value and are case-sensitive. This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables.\nVariable Names in Python There are a number of rules governing the naming of variables:\n Variable names cannot start with a number There cannot be any spaces in a variable name Reserved words cannot be used in variable names  Variable Assignment The equals sign = is used to assign values to variables\ncount = 100 # Assigning an integer value name = \u0026quot;Pat\u0026quot; # A string measure = 100.0 # A floating point value  Standard Data Types Python has five standard data types.\nNumber String List Tuple Dictionary  Python Numbers Python supports four different numerical types:\nint (signed integers) long (long integers) float (floating point numbers) complex (complex numbers)  To define an integer, use the following syntax:\nmyinteger = 7  Python Strings Strings are created by enclosing a sequence of characters in single or double quotes. Strings are immutable i.e. they cannot be changed once they\u0026rsquo;ve been created. They can, however, have characters or other strings added to them.
