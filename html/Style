Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) describe how web pages appear based on a series of rules. They provide an easy way to specify various attributes for HTML tags. Using CSS, a number of style properties can be defined for a HTML element. Each property has a name and a value, 
separated by a colon (:). Each property declaration is separated by a semi-colon (;).

CSS can be used in three ways in a HTML document

External Style Sheet
Style sheet rules are defined in a separate .css file and that file is included in a HTML document using a <link> tag.

Internal Style Sheet 
Style sheet rules are defined in the header section of a HTML document using the <style> tag.

Inline Style Sheet − 
Style sheet rules are defined alongside a HTML element using the style attribute.

External Style Sheet
If you need to define styles for several pages, then its always recommended to define a common style sheet in a separate file. 
A cascading style sheet file will have a .css extension and it will be included in HTML files using the <link> tag.

Example
Consider the style sheet style.css which has following rules −

.red {
   color: red;
}
.thick {
   font-size:20px;
}
.green {
   color:green;
}

Here we defined an external style sheet with three CSS rules that are applicable to three different classes; red, thick and green. 
The external CSS file is included in a HTML document in the following way:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>HTML External CSS</title>
      <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "/html/style.css">
   </head>
   <body>
      <p class = "red">This is red</p>
      <p class = "thick">This is thick</p>
      <p class = "green">This is green</p>
      <p class = "thick green">This is thick and green</p>
   </body>
</html>
This will produce the following result −


Internal Style Sheet
If a Style Sheet is applied to a single document only, these rules can be included in the header section of the 
HTML document using the <style> tag. Rules defined in an internal style sheet override those in an external CSS file.

Example
The above example can be re-written to use an internal style sheet in the same HTML document using the <style> tag.

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
   <head> 
      <title>HTML Internal CSS</title> 
      
      <style type = "text/css"> 
         .red { 
            color: red; 
         } 
         .thick{ 
            font-size:20px; 
         } 
         .green { 
            color:green; 
         } 
      </style> 
   </head>
	
   <body> 
      <p class = "red">This is red</p>  
      <p class = "thick">This is thick</p>  
      <p class = "green">This is green</p>  
      <p class = "thick green">This is thick and green</p> 
   </body>
	
</html>
This will produce the following result −

Inline Style Sheet
Style sheet rules can be applied directly to any HTML element using the style attribute of the tag. This should be done only when a specific change is to be made locally only. Rules that are defined inline override those defined in an external CSS file or the header section within the <style> element.

Example
Reconsidering our example this will look like:

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
   <head> 
      <title>HTML Inline CSS</title> 
   </head>
 
   <body> 
      <p style = "color:red;">This is red</p>  
      <p style = "font-size:20px;">This is thick</p>  
      <p style = "color:green;">This is green</p>  
      <p style = "color:green;font-size:20px;">This is thick and green</p> 
   </body>
 
</html> 
This will produce the following result −
