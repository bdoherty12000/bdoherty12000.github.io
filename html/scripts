A script is a small program that can add interactivity to a website. For example, a script could generate 
a pop-up alert box message, or provide a dropdown menu. Now-a-days, only JavaScript and associated frameworks 
are being used by most of the web developers, VBScript is not even supported by various major browsers.
Functions known as event handlers can be triggered using HTML attributes. JavaScript code can be kept in a 
separate file and included where needed, or it can be defined inside the HTML document itself. 
We will consider both cases.

External JavaScript
If you are going to use functionality in several HTML documents it's better to maintain it in a separate JavaScript 
file and then include it in your HTML documents. JavaScript files have a .js extension and are included in HTML 
files using the <script> tag.

Example
Consider a Javascript function in script.js which has following code

function Hello() {
   alert("Hello, World");
}

Now let's make use of the above external JavaScript file in a HTML document.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Javascript External Script</title>
      <script src = "/html/script.js" type = "text/javascript"/></script>
   </head>

   <body>
      <input type = "button" onclick = "Hello();" name = "ok" value = "Click Me" />
   </body>
</html>

This will produce the following result, where you can try to click on the given button −

Internal Script
Script code can be written directly into a HTML document. It is usually put in the header of the 
HTML document using the <script> tag,but can be put into your source code anywhere in the document 
inside a <script> tag.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>JavaScript Internal Script</title>
      <base href = "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/" />
      
      <script type = "text/JavaScript">
         function Hello() {
            alert("Hello, World");
         }
      </script>
   </head>

   <body>
      <input type = "button" onclick = "Hello();" name = "ok" value = "Click Me" />
   </body>
</html>

This will produce the following result, where you can try to click on the given button −

Event Handlers
Event handlers are functions that are called in response to a mouse or keyboard event. 
The following example explains how to write an event handler.  This function will be called
when a user moves a mouse over a paragraph.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Event Handlers Example</title>
      <base href = "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/" />
      
      <script type = "text/JavaScript">
         function EventHandler() {
            alert("I'm event handler!!");
         }
      </script>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p onmouseover = "EventHandler();">Bring your mouse here to see an alert</p>
   </body>
</html>
Now This will produce the following result. Bring your mouse over this line and see the result −


Hide Scripts from Older Browsers
You can provide alternative info to users whose browsers don't support scripts or for those users who 
have disabled the script option in their browsers using the <noscript> tag.

JavaScript Example:
<script type = "text/JavaScript">
   <!--
      document.write("Hello JavaScript!");
   //-->
</script>

<noscript>Your browser does not support JavaScript!</noscript>

Default Scripting Language
In some cases, a webpage may include multiple script files and and use multiple <script> tags. It's possible to define a default scripting language for all script tags which saves you from specifying the language every time you use a script tag. For example:

<meta http-equiv = "Content-Script-Type" content = "text/JavaScript" />

Its still possible to override the default script language by specifying a language within the script tag.
